Information about the classic system developed by `Java`:

-Basics/Principles
    -[JAVA Concurrent Programming Practice](http://book.douban.com/subject/2148132/)
        classic! It is recommended to read this book first, which is more practical and contains content of `Java 5`. Both actual combat and theory are emphasized. Books nominated for the 16th Jolt Awards.
    -[Java Concurrent Programming](http://book.douban.com/subject/1244021/)
        The work of the famous Doug Lea, although the content is old, but the principle remains the same.
-More advanced concurrency abstraction tools breadth/scientific explanation
    -[Seven weeks and seven concurrency model](https://book.douban.com/subject/26337939/)
